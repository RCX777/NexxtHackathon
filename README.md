## Usage

To install the python virtual environment, use:
```bash
make venv
```

To use the newly created environment, type:

. .venv/bin/activate
```

To run the application, you can simply use:

```

Also, if you want to rewrite `requirements.txt` with your current
environment packages, you can use:
